## Run Locally


🛠️ Getting Started
First, make sure you have Node installed (I built this on v20).

Grab the dependencies: npm i

You’ll need a Gemini API Key. Create a .env.local file in the root and drop it in there like this: GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

Fire it up with npm run dev and it should be live at localhost:3000.
